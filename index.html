                <h2>Develop Without Limits</h2>
                <p>Back end developers are in hot demand, and there are some essential skills you’ll need to learn if
                    you want to become one. But never fear — if you’ve ever peeked under the hood of your car for the
                    fun of it or snuck backstage to get a firsthand look at what goes on behind a show’s curtain, you
                    already have the curiosity that drives back end developers. With a little effort and training, you
                    may just be able to use your natural inquisitiveness to build a rewarding career, but it ultimately
                    depends on acquiring the essential back end development skills.</p>

                <p>A developer community generally defined is a group of developers gathered in a place to achieve a
                    common goal. This transitions your organization from having a support team answering technical
                    questions or having a senior developer answering questions to a self-sufficient community that
                    answers each other's questions.</p>

                <p>COVID-19 apps will help the process of identifying persons ("contacts") who may have been in contact
                    with an infected individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    Several frameworks for building contact-tracing apps have been developed. Privacy concerns have been
                    raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
